After testing on various images with different emotions, images, gender, age..we conclude that..
	Dlib gave very good prediction of face features

Issues:
	1. For the lips:
		for the neutral emotion, its quite fine.
		But coming to the surprise, smile...
			Its covering whole portion of mouth.

Suggested Solutions:
	1. Rather than creating the mask for the entire mouth, need to perform the mask individually for each upper and lower lip.
		Then it may work...just guess please try and implement to know more issues and improvements.

Updated these changes in version_2 and also arranged the code by modularity with our level best documentation for each function.
